% * DC gain of 0.35 (35% uncertainty at low frequency)
% * gain of 1 at 40 rads/TimeUnit (100% uncertainty at 40)
% * High-Frequency gain of 10 (1000% uncertainty at high frequency)

wu = makeweight(0.35,40,10);

%%
% Mimic/repeat procedure to find smallest destabilizing |Delta|, naming the
% perturbation |wDelta| in this case.
% Both *constant, complex* and *real, linear dynamic* perturbations can be
% constructed, following the same procedure, incorporating the weighting
% function |wu|.  Start by computing the norm of the weighted complementary
% sensitivity function.

%% Conclusions
% Using the |svd| command, the smallest destabilizing uncertainty for an
% input-multiplicative uncertainty model is constructed.  It is initially
% constructed as a complex matrix, but can also be constructed as a real,
% linear, dynamic system, using |cnum2sys|.  If the input-multiplicative
% uncertainty model is frequency-dependent, the same process can be used,
% simply incorporating the weighting function

%% Lessons learned
% loopsens provides a complete analysis result of a system's sensitivity 
% properties comprised by a plant and a negative feedback controller. 
% The output of the loopsens could be extracted to do other analysis and
% proof of some theories such as the small gain theory. 
% The smallest plant input uncertainty causing the system to be unstable 
% can be calculated by using the singular value decomposition, where we can
% obtain the delta, and det(I-M*delta) = 0, and the system is on the
% fringe of being unstable. Notice the M = TiNorm
% The instability of the system can also be visualized by probing the poles
% of the uncertainty perturbed system (where the perturbation can be a 
% dynamic system as well as a complex matrix mimicing the dynamic system).
