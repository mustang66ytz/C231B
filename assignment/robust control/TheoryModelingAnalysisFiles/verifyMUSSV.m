%% Upper-Bound quality
% By making approximations, the convex optimization for the upper-bound can
% be solved quickly, at the expense of bound quality.  The |'f'| option
% forces a faster, but less complete minimization, usually resulting in 
% lower quality (ie., larger) upper bounds.  Test this option.  Run this
% section several times to see the effect.

bndA = mussv(M,DeltaA);
bndB = mussv(M,DeltaB);
bndC = mussv(M,DeltaC);
% Based on Delta, muA <= muB <= muC.  The upper bounds should satisfy this
% ordering as well.

%% Conclusions
% The lower and upper bounds for |MUSSV| can be certified using all of the
% information returned by |mussv| in the 2nd output argument.  The lower
% bound is certified by simply exhibiting a perturbation matrix with the
% corect structure that causes singularity.  The lower bound is then the
% reciprocal of that matrix.  The upper bound is certified using the
% S-procedure, which amounts to the existence of "D" and "G" matrices with
% the appropriate structure (consistent with the uncertainty structure)
% that together with |M|, atisfy an inequality.   While the formulae in
% notes and literature are simple, in practice they are slighly more
% complicated due to the possibility of non-square full blocks, which make
% the dimension bookkeeping a bit clumsy.

%% Lessons learned from the file
% In order to use the high-level command mussv, the input argument needs to
% follow the specific rule stated in the official documentation to create
% the block structure. 
% The output of the mussv, the muinfo gives us a comprehensive result about
% the upper bound information (the newlin/young method consisting finding 
% the scailing beta, D, and G, the combination of which is smaller than 1 
% would certify the upperbound; the semidefinite verification of the upperb
% ouds is connected to the lecture slides, which seays the G term is 
% included to shift the complex disk to cover the real term in the delta) 
% and lower bound information (VDelta, which is
% for the lower bound, the product of VDelta and M would make the det(I-M*VDelat
% = 0), and the system will be unstable, thus we could find the structured delta
% for the system to be unstable)?
% If the block is purely complex, then the general formulations of the
% upperbounds and lowerbounds can be simplified, which is consistent with
% the lecture notes. Additionally, for three blocks, where one contains
% another, the largest block would give the smallest minimum singular
% value, and the reciprocal of which is the uppper bound, and thus the
% biggest upperbound among the three.
