%% Uncertain real parameters: |ureal| objects
% Create three uncertain real parameter objects.
p1 = ureal('p1',4)
%%
p2 = ureal('p2',10,'range',[8 14])
%%
p3 = ureal('p3',6,'percentage',[-30 40])
%%
% Questions to consider.
%
% * What is the |Range| of |p1|
% * If the |NominalValue| of |p1| is changed to 3, what is the |Range| of
% |p1|
p1.NominalValue = 3 % cannot change the read only field
p1 = ureal('p1',3) % construct a new uncertain real parameter, the range is
% still [-1,1]
% * If the |NominalValue| of |p2| is changed to 11, what is the |Range| of
% |p2|
p2 = ureal('p2',11,'range',[8 14]) % the nominal value is changed to 11 but
% the range keeps the same
% * If the |NominalValue| of |p3| is changed to 10, what is the |Range| of
% |p3|
%
p3 = ureal('p3',10,'percentage',[-30 40]) % the nominal value can be changed 
% to 10 and the range keeps the same 
% Experiment at the command line to answer these questions, and confirm
% your understanding in how the objects behave.

%% Real Parametric Uncertainty 
% Use |ureal| objects to construct a damping ratio with nominal value of
% 0.1 and 35% uncertainty.
zeta = ureal('zeta',0.1,'Percentage',35)
%%
% Next, construct an uncertain natural frequency with nominal value of 4
% rad/sec and an uncertain range of 3.3 to 5 rad/sec.  Examine the properties
% of this object.
wn = ureal('wn',4,'Range',[3.3 5]);
get(wn)

%% Sample Parametric Uncertainty
% The |usample| command can be used to generate random samples of the
% real parameteric uncertainty defined above. 
RSamples = usample([wn;zeta],100);
plot(RSamples(1,:),RSamples(2,:),'bx');

%% Uncertain matrices
% Create three real parameters.
a = ureal('a',2);
b = ureal('b',0.5,'Perc',30);
c = ureal('c',10,'range',[7 11]);
%%
% Use standard Matlab manipulations to concatenate these objects, along
% with numerical values into an uncertain matrix.

%% Sampling and Substitution
% Sample 150 points from the uncertainty space of |G|
[Gs,S] = usample(G,150);
%%
size(Gs)
%%
S
%%
% Sample 15 points from a rectangular grid, formed by 15 points in the
% uncertainty space spanned by |'a'| and |'b'|, and 10 points from the
% space spanned by |'c'|.
[Gs,S] = usample(G,{'a' 'b'},15,'c',10);
size(Gs)
%%
% The samples are stored in |S|, and can used for substitution into any
% other object which has dependence on |'a'|, |'b'| and/or |'c'|.  Here,
% for illustrative purposes, recover |Gs| from the samples
Gsrecover = usubs(G,S);
norm(Gs(:)-Gsrecover(:))  % floating point roundoff in substitution
%%
% Substitute specific values for |'a'|, |'b'| and |'c'|
usubs(G,'a',1,'b',2,'c',3)

%% Dynamic Uncertainty
% Create an uncertain linear time-invariant object, |Delta|.  By default,
% all |ultidyn| objects are norm bounded by 1 at all frequency. 
iosize = [1 1];
Delta = ultidyn('Delta',iosize);
%%
Delta.Type
%%
Delta.Bound

%% Sample Dynamic Uncertainty
% The |usample| command can be used to generate random instances of 
% the uncertain objects.  For example, each instance of |Delta| is stable
% and has state dimension equal to 1, as specified by the |SampleStateDim|
% property. 
Delta.SampleStateDim
%%
nSamples = 10;
DSamples = usample(Delta, nSamples);
bode(DSamples);

%%
% The state dimension of the uncertain instances can be modified using
% the |SampleStateDim| property.  Change this property value so that
% subsequent samples will be of state dimension 5.  
Delta.SampleStateDim = 5;
DSamples2 = usample(Delta, nSamples);
bode(DSamples2);

%% Uncertain systems using |tf|
tau = ureal('tau',0.5,'Perc',[-50 100]);
gamma = ureal('gamma',1,'Perc',[-30 60]);
Delta = ultidyn('Delta',[1 1],'Type','GainBounded');
W = makeweight(0.2,10,20);
P = tf(gamma,[tau 1])*(1 + W*Delta)
%%
% Although |P| is an uncertain state-space object (the is no uncertain
% transfer function class), the nominal value of |P| can be converted back
% to a transfer function object.
tf(P.NominalValue)
%%
% The step response is computed on 20 samples, as well as the nominal
% value.
step(P, 2)

%% |feedback| for simple closed-loop systems
% A simple PI controller is effective on the uncertain plant
K = tf([2.4 8],[1 0]);
T = feedback(P,K);
step(P,'r', T,'g', 2);

%% Build Uncertain Model using uncertain elements
% Construct the 2nd order system with uncertain damping ratio and 
% natural frequency.  In addition, include a multiplicative uncertainty 
% to model overall uncertainty in the dynamics.  The multiplicative weight 
% |Wmult| models 10% dynamic uncertainty at low frequencies, 100% at 10
% rad/TimeUnit, and 1000%  uncertainty at high frequencies.  
Wmult = makeweightb(0.1,10,10);
G = tf(wn^2,[1 2*zeta*wn wn^2])*(1+Wmult*Delta)

%%
% Plot the magnitude of samples of the uincertain model, as well as the
% nominal model, and the multiplicative uncertainty weight.

%% Uncertain State-space models
% Create several Uncertain parameters and uncertain matrices.
p = ureal('p',10,'Percentage',10);
r = ureal('r',-1,'Percentage',30);
A = [r p;-p r];  % UMAT
B = eye(2);      % DOUBLE
C = [1 p;-p 1];  % UMAT
%%
% Use the |ss| method to pack these uncertain matrices into an uncertain
% state-space model.
H = ss(A,B,C,0)
%%
% Compute the poles of 50 samples of |H|, and plot a scatter plot.
pH = pole(usample(H,50));
plot(pH(:),'x')
%%
% A step response of |H| shows the modest variability in frequency and
% damping.
step(H,3)
%%
% Add high-frequency, unmodeled dynamics to |H|, using a |ultidyn| element,
% and a weighting function |W|.  Note that |G| has dependence on 3
% uncertain elements
Delta = ultidyn('Delta',[2 2],'SampleStateDim',4); %default: GainBounded, Bound = 1
W = makeweight(0.2, 50, 20);  % W(j0)=0.2, |W(j50)|=1, W(j?)=20
G = H*(eye(2)+W*Delta)
%%
% The step response of |G| is similar to |H|, but has noticably more
% variability on short time-scales (high frequency).
step(G,3)

%% Sample Bode Plots
% Generate Bode plots for 15 instances of the
% random model.  The nominal Bode plots are shown for
% comparison.

GSamples = usample(G,15);

%% Insight into the data structure
% Create an uncertain matrix from the existing |ureal| objects.
G = [p1  p1*p2; p2  p3];
% Manipulate, using typical Matlab commands and row/column referencing and
% assignment syntax.
Gext = [inv(G)  G];
Row1 = G(1,:)
G(3,:) = [5 p1*p2*p3];
%%
% The uncertain matrix can be decomposed into it's constituent parts.
[M,DeltaN] = lftdata(G); % lft(DeltaN,M) equals G
class(M)
class(DeltaN)
Resid = G - lft(DeltaN,M);
usample(Resid,4)

%% Conclusions
% The uncertain objects |ureal| and |ultidyn| can be used to form uncertain
% matrices and uncertain state-space models.  Many of the usual operations
% and manipulations for numerical matrices and state-space models are
% implemented, and behave as expected.

%% Lessons learned
% This tutorial teaches me how to create uncertain objects by specifying
% their nominal value and range or percentage of variability.
% Additionally, how to sample certain number of points from the uncertain
% objects created.
% Additionally, how to use the ultidyn function to generate uncertain
% linear time invariant dynamical system, and use the usample to extract
% certain number of sample variables from the uncertain dynamical system.
% Last but not the least, how to use the lftdata to decompose an unceratin
% system into its consitituents, the nominal part and the uncertain parts.
% And how to use the lft to form back the original uncertain system with
% thenominal part and the uncertain part.
